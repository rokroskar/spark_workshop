    "* `map` -- the most basic component of map/reduce with 1:1 correspondence to original data\n",
    "* `flatMap` -- returns a number of items different from the original data\n",
    "* `filter` -- only keep those elements for which the filter function evaluates to `True`\n",
    "* `distinct` -- only retain the unique elements of the entire RDD\n",
    "* `reduceByKey` -- group elements by key and keep the data distributed \n",
    "* `mapPartitions` -- similar to `map` but done on a per-partition basis (requires a generator function)\n",
    "* `sortBy` -- sort using the provided function\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformations are evaluated \"lazily\" - only executed once an *action* is performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actions include: \n",
    "* `collect` -- pulls all elements of the RDD to the driver (often a bad idea!!)\n",
    "* `collectAsMap` -- like `collect` but returns a dictionary to the driver which makes it easy to lookup the keys \n",
    "* `reduce` -- reduces the entire RDD to a single value\n",
    "* `countByKey`/`countByValue`\n",
    "* `take` -- yields a desired number of items to the driver\n",
    "* `first` -- returns the first element of the RDD to the driver -- very useful for inspecting the data!"

    "\n",
    "* When an RDD is transformed, this **transformation** is not automatically carried out. \n",
    "* Instead, the system remembers how to get from one RDD to another and only executes whatever is needed for the **action** that is being done. \n",
    "* this allows one to build up a complex \"pipeline\" and easily tweak/rerun it in its entirety \n",
    "\n",
    "## Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "* data of each RDD is partitioned and each partition is assigned to an executor\n",

    "\n",
    "* RDD evalutations are *lazy* \n",
    "* whenever an action is performed, the entire lineage graph is recalculated\n",
    "* unless! an intermediate RDD is cached -- then it is only calculated once and reused from memory each subsequent time\n",
