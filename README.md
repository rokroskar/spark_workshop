# spark workshop materials
Materials for an introductory workshop to using Spark in data processing.

Notebooks can be downloaded and run on a local machine or any spark cluster.

## Outline
### Basics

* map/reduce/filter operations
* some python concepts that are useful for Spark
   * lambda functions
   * list comprehensions (generator expressions) 
   * generators (needed for mapPartitions)
   * key/value tuples

### Applying the basics in Spark
* description of Spark data and computation model (RDDs)
* different ways of running Spark apps 
   * local (i.e. laptop)
   * stand-alone (i.e. Euler)
   * YARN (Brutus cluster)
   * Amazon EC2
* map/reduce in Spark
   * intro to the computation graph
   * creating key, value RDDs
   * standard library functions (reduceByKey, aggregate, sortBy, etc.)

### Advanced
* optimizations/profiling
* writing aggregator classes
