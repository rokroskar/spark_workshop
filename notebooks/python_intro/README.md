# Introduction: 
## Python concepts and exercises

The notebook [Spark workshop introduction](./Spark_workshop_introduction.ipynb) contains 
a general introduction to the material and the somewhat advanced python concepts that will be useful for using Spark. 

### How to use the exercise notebooks

The notebook titled [python_exercises_blank.ipynb](./python_exercises_blank.ipynb) contains the exercises without solutions. 
Obviously, the other, almost identical notebook with *SOLUTIONS* in its filename contains the solutions.
