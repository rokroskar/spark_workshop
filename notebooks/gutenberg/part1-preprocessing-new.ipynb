    "Note that our dataset at the moment is composed of `(dictionary, text)` tuples. This is not ideal for several reasons: first, complex structures like dictionaries are more expensive to serialize, so replacing them by simple integer IDs can improve performance. And second, dictionaries are not hashable so cannot serve as keys. \n",

    "The solution is to replace the dictionary with just a single ID integer (in this case we already have it, the `gid` or the gutenberg ID of the book). However, as we manipulate the dataset, we will still want ready access to the metadata, but at the moment we have no efficient way of working with it. What we want is to generate a lookup table of metadata that can easily be retrieved when needed. \n",

    "For these kinds of situations when passing around some data to all the workers is required, you should use Spark's [broadcast variable](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#broadcast-variables) mechanism. By placing data inside a broadcast variable, you make it available to all the workers and it only needs to be sent across the network once. The next time a value from the broadcast variable is needed, it's simply taken from the local executor's memory, incurring no extra network cost. "
