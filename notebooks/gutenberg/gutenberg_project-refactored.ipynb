Depending on what your application is doing, you may need more of one or the other. For example, if you are running a lot of iterative operations on a large dataset, you probably want a good amount of memory for RDD caching. On the other hand, if you are doing lots of expensive shuffles that occur when sorting of grouping by key, you may want more shuffle memory. Note that if either one starts to run low, your application (hopefully) won't crash, but instead simply spill to local disk. \n",

    "When you use `sc.parallelize` to distribute a dataset across the cluster, you can choose the number of partitions across which to distribute the dataset. The higher the number of partitions, the higher the \"parallelism\". When Spark subsequently executes maps and reduces on this dataset, it does so by dispatching tasks to different executors, which then request the cores under their control to do the actual work. By increasing the number of partitions, you increase the number of tasks - more tasks gives the Spark scheduler more flexibility in distributing the work across the cluster and therefore maximally leveraging the compute resources at its disposal. In some cases, where a single partition might require a lot of memory it can cause `Out of memory` errors - in such cases, simply reducing the amount of data per task by increasing the parallelism can help. \n",

These mean that either the data chunk was physically present on the disk of the node that was reading it in (`NODE LOCAL`) or it was on one of the nodes on the same switch (`RACK LOCAL`).

    "Lets have a quick look at the number of words in these books. We'll do this by taking the values (text) of the `text_rdd` (there is a `values()` method that discards the keys of the RDD), use the `split` method of the text string to break it up into a list of words, and then use the built-in `len` method to get the length of this sequence. Finally, we will use the `collect` method to extract the numbers to the driver. "

    "Note that our dataset at the moment is composed of `(dictionary, text)` tuples. This is not ideal for several reasons: first, complex structures like dictionaries are more expensive to serialize, so replacing them by simple integer IDs can improve performance. And second, dictionaries are not hashable so cannot serve as keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to replace the dictionary with just a single ID integer (in this case we already have it, the `gid` or the gutenberg ID of the book). However, as we manipulate the dataset, we will still want ready access to the metadata, but at the moment we have no efficient way of working with it. What we want is to generate a lookup table of metadata that can easily be retrieved when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these kinds of situations when passing around some data to all the workers is required, you should use Spark's [broadcast variable](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#broadcast-variables) mechanism. By placing data inside a broadcast variable, you make it available to all the workers and it only needs to be sent across the network once. The next time a value from the broadcast variable is needed, it's simply taken from the local executor's memory, incurring no extra network cost. "

    "### Reducing network traffic by using `mapPartition`\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of operation is a good candidate for first computing a partial result on each partition and then following with a reduce step. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our `histogram` function above, the `reduceByKey` step requires a reshuffling of the data which means spending potentially a lot of time in network communication and other overhead associated with creating distributed hash tables for all the keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, since our binning function effectively already hashes the values anyway, we can avoid this by instructing first each partition to calculate its local histogram and then simply adding up the histograms in the end. In this way, we are basically combinging the `map` operation with a local `reduce` operation, and since the number of bins is always relatively small, we end up sending a trivial amount of data across the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where our knowledge of generators comes in handy, because the method [`mapPartitions`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.mapPartitions) *requires* a generator function. "

Below, this is accomplished using the `bin_partition` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we define a new `histogram_partition` function that uses `bin_partition` to compute the local histograms and a simple addition in a `reduce` operation to sum up the histograms in the end. "

    "During a `reduceByKey`, or any other reduction for that matter, data must be shuffled around the cluster and combined. Other common RDD methods like `join`, `sortByKey` etc. also typically require lots of data shuffling. By default, this is done in an intelligent way by first reducing values locally on each partition, and then combining the results of the partitions. Still, as is the case here, for common keys, every partition will have to send its results to others. This can result in a lot of temporary file IO if the data that needs to be communicated can't all be held in memory on all of the executors. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way around this is to pre-partition the data ahead of time so that the same keys land on the same partition by design. This results in much less data needing to be shipped around the network and can improve the performance. Of course, at the cost of an expensive initial shuffle that takes place during the partitioning step! But if many \"by key\" have to be done on the same data, it might be worth it. "

    "\n",
    "### Converting documents into vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "To make quantitative analysis of the corpus possible, we will convert each document into a vector that represents the word counts for each word appearing in the document. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will look something like this. Imagine we have have a corpus consisting of two \"documents\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    document 1: \"a dog bit me\"\n",
    "    document 2: \"i bit the dog back\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then our corpus vocabulary (of 1-grams) is\n",
    "\n",
    "    [\"a\", \"dog\", \"bit\", \"me\", \"i\", \"the\", \"back\"]\n",

    "    document 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "    document 2: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n",

    "\n",
    "Once each document is converted to a vector, doing the word counts for sub-groups of documents is a simple vector addition operation.

From there, it is trivial to look up the desired word and plot the relative frequency vs. year. \n",

    "2. use filter to retain only the first 100000 words \n",

In a \"normal\" reduction, the workers send their results to the driver, which is tasked with putting it all together -- however, if these partial results are large (as is potentially the case here) then the driver can run into memory issues. Furthermore, most of the cluster is sitting idle while the driver performs the aggregation. `treeAggregate` fixes this by performing partial aggregations on the workers and only sending the final stages to the driver. See this [blog post](https://databricks.com/blog/2014/09/22/spark-1-1-mllib-performance-improvements.html) for a bit more description of this method. \n",

    "The aggregation methods are powerful because the \"aggregate\" can be any object -- we can write a class that gets passed around to do the aggregation, for example. Aggregation methods are more general reduction methods because they allow you to change the type of the variables -- in our case here, we are converting the data `(year, vector)` tuples into a dictionary of arrays. \n",

    "If you are very motivated, you can adapt the workflow above to work with higher-order n-grams and allow for the lookup of phrases (i.e. \"world war\") instead of just single words. To do this, you have to create a new `word_lookup` table and regenerate the vectors. Since single words (i.e. one-grams) will dominate, it might make sense to build separate list of top N-grams (top two-grams, top three-grams) and then merge them together into a vocabulary map. Beware that the size of the data will increase quickly for N > 1!"
