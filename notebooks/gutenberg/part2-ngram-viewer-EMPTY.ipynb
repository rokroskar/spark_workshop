    "\n",
    "To get the yearly sums, we will turn the metadata of each document into its publication year (i.e. the key will be the year, the value is the vector) and then do an aggregation by year. \n",

    "We will use the powerful [`treeAggregate`](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html?highlight=values#pyspark.RDD.treeAggregate) method, which requires that we specify three different components:\n",

    "The way `treeAggregate` works is that it performs the reduction in a tree pattern in order to minimize the strain on the driver. In a \"normal\" reduction, the workers send their results to the driver, which is tasked with putting it all together -- however, if these partial results are large (as is potentially the case here) then the driver can run into memory issues. Furthermore, most of the cluster is sitting idle while the driver performs the aggregation. `treeAggregate` fixes this by performing partial aggregations on the workers and only sending the final stages to the driver. See this [blog post](https://databricks.com/blog/2014/09/22/spark-1-1-mllib-performance-improvements.html) for a bit more description of this method. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregation methods are powerful because the \"aggregate\" can be any object -- we can write a class that gets passed around to do the aggregation, for example. Aggregation methods are more general reduction methods because they allow you to change the type of the variables -- in our case here, we are converting the data `(year, vector)` tuples into a dictionary of arrays. \n",
