# Spark tutorial notebooks

## Using this material 

See the [general README](../README.md) for information on how to get started. Once you have the notebook running, you can dive in to the three directories:

* [python_intro](https://github.com/rokroskar/spark_workshop/tree/master/notebooks/python_intro) - basic introduction to Big Data and python concepts
* [spark_intro](https://github.com/rokroskar/spark_workshop/tree/master/notebooks/spark_intro) - essential Spark skills
* [gutenberg](https://github.com/rokroskar/spark_workshop/tree/master/notebooks/gutenberg) - "project" notebook building up an analysis of the Gutenberg books corpus

You should start by having a look at the python introduction notebook (where you can also execute cells) which introduces some essential python concepts. When you open the notebooks running on the notebook server (i.e. in your browser at `localhost:8889`), you can execute any cell in the notebook by entering `Shift+Enter`. You can also modify any of the cells to experiment. Once you're happy with the python introduction, continue on to the notebook marked "EMPTY" in the same directory and complete the exercises.
