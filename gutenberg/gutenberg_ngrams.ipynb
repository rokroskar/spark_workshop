By increasing the number of partitions, you increase the number of tasks - more tasks gives the Spark scheduler more flexibility in distributing the work across the cluster and therefore maximally leveraging the compute resources at its disposal.

hour we work the fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc this projected audience is one hundred million readers if our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce million dollars per hour this year as we release thirtytwo text files per month or more etexts in for a total of if these reach just of the computerized population then the total should reach billion etexts the goal of project gutenberg is to give away one trillion etext files by the december x trillion this is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers which is only of the present number of computer users should have at least twice as many computer

rota chigualmente e mossa wo ich die baukunst eine erstarrte musik nenne johann wolfgang goethe march i found dante in a bar the poet had indeed lost the true way to be found reduced to party chatter in a capitol hill basement but i had found him at last i must have been drinking in the dark tavern of error for i did not even realize i had begun the dolorous path followed by many since the poets journey of ad actually no one spoke a word about dante or his divine comedy rather i heard a secondhand goethe call architecture frozen music soon i took my second step through the gate to a people lost this time on a more respectable occasion a lecture at the catholic university of america clio the muse of history must have been aiding prof schumacher that evening because it sustained my full threehour attention even after i had just presented an allnight project there i heard of a most astonishing italian translation of la divina commedia di dante alighieri an italian architect giuseppi terragni had translated the comedy into the danteum a projected stone and glass monument to poet and poem near the basilica of maxentius in rome do not look for the danteum in the eternal city in true dantean form politics stood in the way of its construction in ironically this literatureinspired building can itself most easily be found in book form reading this book i remembered goethes quote about frozen music did terragni try to freeze dantes medieval miracle of song certainly a coldpoem seems artistically repulsive unflattering comparisons to the lake of cocytus spring to mind too while i cannot read italian i can read some german after locating the original quotation i discovered that frozen is a problematic though common translation of goethes original erstarrte the verb erstarren more properly means to solidify or to stiffen this suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation nor can simple thawing yield the original work like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst a muse indeed the danteum is not a physical translation of the poem terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the comedy literally into a nonliterary work the danteum would not be a stage set rather terragni generated his design from the comedys structure not its finishes the poem is divided into three canticles of thirtythree cantos each plus one extra in the first the inferno making a total of one hundred cantos each canto is composed of threeline tercets the first and third lines rhyme the second line rhymes with the beginning of the next tercet establishing a kind of overlap reflected in the overlapping motif of the danteum design dantes realms are further subdivided the inferno is composed of nine levels the vestibule makes a tenth purgatory has seven terraces plus two ledges in an antepurgatory adding these to the earthly paradise yields ten zones paradise is composed of nine heavens empyrean makes the tenth in the inferno sinners are organized by three vices incontinence violence and fraud and further subdivided by the seven deadly sins in purgatory penance is ordered on the basis of three types of natural love paradise is organized on the basis of three types of divine love and further subdivided according to the three theological and four cardinal virtues thomas schumacher the danteum princeton architectural press by translating the structure terragni could then layer the literal and the spiritual meanings of the poem without allowing either to dominate these layers of meaning are native to the divine comedy as they are native to much medieval literature although modern readers and tourists may not be so familiar with them they are literal allegorical moral and anagogical i offer you st thomas of aquinas definition of these last three as they relate to sacred scripture this spiritual sense has a threefold division so far as the things of the old law signify the things of the new law there is the allegorical sense so far as the things done in christ or so far as the things which signify christ are types of what we ought to do there is the moral sense but so far as they signify what relates to eternal glory there is the anagogical sense summa theologica i within the danteum the poets meanings lurk in solid form an example the danteum design does have spaces literally associated with the comedy the dark wood of error inferno purgatorio and the paradiso but these spaces also relate among themselves spiritually dante often highlights a virtue by first condemning its corruption within dantes system justice is the greatest of the cardinal virtues its corruption fraud is the most contemptible of vices because dante saw the papacy as the most precious of sacred institutions corrupt popes figure prominently among the damned in the poets inferno in the danteum the materiality of the worldly dark wood directly opposes the transcendence of the paradiso in the realm of error every thought is lost and secular while in heaven every souls intent is directed toward god the shadowy inferno of the danteum mirrors the purgatorios illuminated ascent to heaven purgatory embodies hope and growth where hell chases its own dark inertia such is the cosmography shared by terragni and dante in this postscript i intend neither to fully examine the meaning nor the plan of the danteum but rather to evince the power that art has acted as a catalyst to other artists the danteum a modern design inspired by a medieval poem is but one example dantes poem is filled with characters epitomizing the full range of vices and virtues of human personalities dantes characters come from his present and literatures past they are mythological biblical classical ancient and medieval they rather than calliope and her sisters were dantes muses la divina commedia seems a natural candidate to complete project gutenbergs first milleditio and to begin its second thousand etexts although distinctly medieval its continuum of influence spans the renaissance and modernity terragni saw his place within the comedy as surely as dante saw his own we too fit within dantes understanding of the human condition we differ less from our past than we might like to believe t s eliot understood this when he wrote dante and shakespeare divide the modern world between them there is no third so now dante joins shakespeare etext in the project gutenberg collection two works that influenced dante are also part of the collection the bible and virgils aeneid other major influences st thomas of aquinas summa theologica the metamorphoses of ovid and aristotles nicomachean ethics are available in electronic form at other internet sites if one searches enough he may even find a computer rendering of the danteum on the internet by presenting this electronic text to project gutenberg it is my hope that in will not rest in a computer unknown and unread it is my hope that artists will see themselves in the divine comedy and be inspired just as dante ran the paths left by virgil and st thomas that lead him to the stars dennis mccarthy july atlanta georgia usa

    "Compare this read time to nearly two minutes it took to read it off the local filesystem initially. If you look at the details for this stage in the Spark UI you can understand why this is: in the column named \"locality level\", you see that for many tasks it says `NODE LOCAL` while for others it might say `RACK LOCAL`. These mean that either the data chunk was physically present on the disk of the node that was reading it in (`NODE LOCAL`) or it was on one of the nodes on the same switch (`RACK LOCAL`). Of course the additional advantage is not having to deal with the filesystem overhead of 10k+ small files.  "

    "During a `reduceByKey`, or any other reduction for that matter, data must be shuffled around the cluster and combined. By default, this is done in an intelligent way by first reducing values locally on each partition, and then combining the results of the partitions. Still, as is the case here, for common keys, every partition will have to send its results to others. This can result in a lot of temporary file IO if the data that needs to be communicated can't all be held in memory on all of the executors. \n",

This results in much less data needing to be shipped around the network and can improve the performance. Of course, at the cost of an expensive initial shuffle! But if many reductions have to be done on the same data, it might be worth it. "
