With the YARN scheduler, it's not very obvious how to specify this value nicely, but using the environment variable seems to work. Note that this has to be done *before* importing the `pyspark` package. Once this is set and the `pyspark` package imported, you may need to restart the python kernel if you want to make a change.

On the other hand, if you are doing lots of expensive shuffles that occur when sorting of grouping by key, you may want more shuffle memory.

The higher the number of partitions, the higher the \"parallelism\". When Spark subsequently executes maps and reduces on this dataset, it does so by dispatching tasks to different executors, which then request the cores under their control to do the actual work. By increasing the number of partitions, you increase the number of tasks - more tasks gives the Spark scheduler more flexibility in distributing the work across the cluster and therefore maximally leveraging the compute resources at its disposal. In some cases, where a single partition might require a lot of memory it can cause `Out of memory` errors - in such cases, simply reducing the amount of data per task by increasing the parallelism can help. \n",

rota chigualmente e mossa wo ich die baukunst eine erstarrte musik nenne johann wolfgang goethe march i found dante in a bar the poet had indeed lost the true way to be found reduced to party chatter in a capitol hill basement but i had found him at last i must have been drinking in the dark tavern of error for i did not even realize i had begun the dolorous path followed by many since the poets journey of ad actually no one spoke a word about dante or his divine comedy rather i heard a secondhand goethe call architecture frozen music soon i took my second step through the gate to a people lost this time on a more respectable occasion a lecture at the catholic university of america clio the muse of history must have been aiding prof schumacher that evening because it sustained my full threehour attention even after i had just presented an allnight project there i heard of a most astonishing italian translation of la divina commedia di dante alighieri an italian architect giuseppi terragni had translated the comedy into the danteum a projected stone and glass monument to poet and poem near the basilica of maxentius in rome do not look for the danteum in the eternal city in true dantean form politics stood in the way of its construction in ironically this literatureinspired building can itself most easily be found in book form reading this book i remembered goethes quote about frozen music did terragni try to freeze dantes medieval miracle of song certainly a coldpoem seems artistically repulsive unflattering comparisons to the lake of cocytus spring to mind too while i cannot read italian i can read some german after locating the original quotation i discovered that frozen is a problematic though common translation of goethes original erstarrte the verb erstarren more properly means to solidify or to stiffen this suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation nor can simple thawing yield the original work like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst a muse indeed the danteum is not a physical translation of the poem terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the comedy literally into a nonliterary work the danteum would not be a stage set rather terragni generated his design from the comedys structure not its finishes the poem is divided into three canticles of thirtythree cantos each plus one extra in the first the inferno making a total of one hundred cantos each canto is composed of threeline tercets the first and third lines rhyme the second line rhymes with the beginning of the next tercet establishing a kind of overlap reflected in the overlapping motif of the danteum design dantes realms are further subdivided the inferno is composed of nine levels the vestibule makes a tenth purgatory has seven terraces plus two ledges in an antepurgatory adding these to the earthly paradise yields ten zones paradise is composed of nine heavens empyrean makes the tenth in the inferno sinners are organized by three vices incontinence violence and fraud and further subdivided by the seven deadly sins in purgatory penance is ordered on the basis of three types of natural love paradise is organized on the basis of three types of divine love and further subdivided according to the three theological and four cardinal virtues thomas schumacher the danteum princeton architectural press by translating the structure terragni could then layer the literal and the spiritual meanings of the poem without allowing either to dominate these layers of meaning are native to the divine comedy as they are native to much medieval literature although modern readers and tourists may not be so familiar with them they are literal allegorical moral and anagogical i offer you st thomas of aquinas definition of these last three as they relate to sacred scripture this spiritual sense has a threefold division so far as the things of the old law signify the things of the new law there is the allegorical sense so far as the things done in christ or so far as the things which signify christ are types of what we ought to do there is the moral sense but so far as they signify what relates to eternal glory there is the anagogical sense summa theologica i within the danteum the poets meanings lurk in solid form an example the danteum design does have spaces literally associated with the comedy the dark wood of error inferno purgatorio and the paradiso but these spaces also relate among themselves spiritually dante often highlights a virtue by first condemning its corruption within dantes system justice is the greatest of the cardinal virtues its corruption fraud is the most contemptible of vices because dante saw the papacy as the most precious of sacred institutions corrupt popes figure prominently among the damned in the poets inferno in the danteum the materiality of the worldly dark wood directly opposes the transcendence of the paradiso in the realm of error every thought is lost and secular while in heaven every souls intent is directed toward god the shadowy inferno of the danteum mirrors the purgatorios illuminated ascent to heaven purgatory embodies hope and growth where hell chases its own dark inertia such is the cosmography shared by terragni and dante in this postscript i intend neither to fully examine the meaning nor the plan of the danteum but rather to evince the power that art has acted as a catalyst to other artists the danteum a modern design inspired by a medieval poem is but one example dantes poem is filled with characters epitomizing the full range of vices and virtues of human personalities dantes characters come from his present and literatures past they are mythological biblical classical ancient and medieval they rather than calliope and her sisters were dantes muses la divina commedia seems a natural candidate to complete project gutenbergs first milleditio and to begin its second thousand etexts although distinctly medieval its continuum of influence spans the renaissance and modernity terragni saw his place within the comedy as surely as dante saw his own we too fit within dantes understanding of the human condition we differ less from our past than we might like to believe t s eliot understood this when he wrote dante and shakespeare divide the modern world between them there is no third so now dante joins shakespeare etext in the project gutenberg collection two works that influenced dante are also part of the collection the bible and virgils aeneid other major influences st thomas of aquinas summa theologica the metamorphoses of ovid and aristotles nicomachean ethics are available in electronic form at other internet sites if one searches enough he may even find a computer rendering of the danteum on the internet by presenting this electronic text to project gutenberg it is my hope that in will not rest in a computer unknown and unread it is my hope that artists will see themselves in the divine comedy and be inspired just as dante ran the paths left by virgil and st thomas that lead him to the stars dennis mccarthy july atlanta georgia usa

These mean that either the data chunk was physically present on the disk of the node that was reading it in (`NODE LOCAL`) or it was on one of the nodes on the same switch (`RACK LOCAL`).

This can result in a lot of temporary file IO if the data that needs to be communicated can't all be held in memory on all of the executors. \n",
